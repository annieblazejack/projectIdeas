## Project Ideas

### Sporty Spice Wardrobe Collector

This is a web app that searches for clothing and accessories that Sporty Spice might wear. It may use a machine learning algorithm seeded with images of Sporty Spice.

### Mentorship App for hospital patients

This is like a dating app for people experiencing sickness or injury. It suggests mentorship pairings based on geography and type of injury/illness. When my parents-in-law broke their hips, advice from people in their community who had recovered from similar injuries was invaluable. Now they are experts in navigating the local medical system. They know what questions to ask doctors and nurses, how to coordinate home health care, etc. They would happily share this knowledge with others.
